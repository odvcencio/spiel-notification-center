# Spiel Notification Center

This is the Spiel Notification Center readme.

We will be implementing a simple Notification Center in Golang that sends Emails and Push Notifications on specific situations.
This service utilizes NSQ messaging platform to receive updates from other microservices.

@oscarv and @makan are the principals of this project.

This project is solely an MVP for the purposes of showing a working demo to YC.
